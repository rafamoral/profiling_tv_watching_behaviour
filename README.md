# Profiling Customer Television Watching Behaviour Using A Novel Bayesian Hierarchical Joint Model for Time-to-Event and Count Data, by Moral et al.

Here we make all code and data available to ensure full reproducibility of our paper.

- `moral_et_al_bayesian_model.R` loads and wrangles the data, and fits the Bayesian joint model;
- `moral_et_al_post_processing.R` runs the exploratory analyses, correlation plots and clustering;
- `moral_et_al_classification.py` runs all classification methods based on the model outputs and the naive approach using the raw data.
