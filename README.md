# Profiling Customer Television Watching Behaviour Using A Novel Bayesian Hierarchical Joint Model for Time-to-Event and Count Data, by Moral et al.

Here we make all code available to implement the methodologies used in the paper:

- `moral_et_al_bayesian_model.R` loads and wrangles the data, and fits the Bayesian joint model;
- `moral_et_al_post_processing.R` runs the exploratory analyses, correlation plots and clustering;
- `moral_et_al_classification.ipynb` runs all classification methods based on the model outputs and the naive approach using the raw data.

We do not make the raw data available to avoid intellectual property violations against BT or YouView.
